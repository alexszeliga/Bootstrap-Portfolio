<!-- Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)


Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:



A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)


eg. On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!


Responsive images


BONUS
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)


Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages. -->

                                By the time I completed high school, I felt very confident that the most exciting (and likely most lucrative) careers available
                                to my cohort were in technology and computer science. Upon graduating, I had convinced myself
                                that traditional college was out of my reach. I started a long slog through a number of jobs
                                and community colleges trying to find something I could make my life’s work. Personally,
                                I felt that writing code was as close to an exercise in creativity that one in the field
                                of computer science could reliably be paid for, but I lacked the savvy to understand how
                                to apply my talents.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                Flashback to my middle school years; when I was first set loose on the early Internet. Largely unsupervised, I did what any
                                13 year old boy would do: I found an AOL chatroom full of nerdy teenagers who wrote add-on
                                software. Most of the software was largely benign. Useful in kicking other users out of chat
                                rooms and disconnecting them from the internet by overloading their hardware, but little
                                else. It was an exercise in angst; after finding a local friend with similar interests, I
                                made my own add-on software using a dubious version of Visual Basic 3.0 and began to use
                                and distribute it in the community.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                As excited as tech professionals are supposed to be about the early Internet, the reality is that it was pretty boring. It
                                was slow, there wasn’t much useful information, and if your mom needed the phone you had
                                to sign off. This was an important confluence for me. My computer was a hand-me-down. In
                                the era of Windows 98 SE, I was running Windows 3.11, so gaming on my computer was still
                                largely done in DOS. While poking around in DOS, I discovered QBASIC.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                My functional knowledge of Visual Basic all of a sudden began to frame a new understanding. I printed out and referenced
                                QBASIC documentation and was able to make my computer do incredible things by copying source
                                code out of magazines. The Summer that I learned QBASIC was the spark that informed my realization
                                at the end of high school.
                            </p>

                                The circumstances of the time which led me away from the lucrative and exciting path of a developer seem so insignificant
                                now. While my attempts at higher education and my early career in retail led me askew, the
                                financial crash of 2008 finally dialed in my focus.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                I knew I needed to be in tech, but lacked the skills to do so. I opted to leverage my retail skills and take a lateral jump
                                into eCommerce. When I was hired by RevZilla.com, there were fewer than twenty employees.
                                RevZilla was more than a blessing, it was the business education I never knew I wanted. I
                                knew that building things was what I wanted to do, and RevZilla’s number one goal was to
                                grow quickly but not as a means to attract investment. RevZilla was a true experiment by
                                the founding partners to build something that would not only dominate, but also stand the
                                test of time.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                I started in fulfillment operations as the receiving manager. I built procedures and documentation along side of a revolving
                                cast of fulfillment center managers who were alternately fired for cause or poached to loftier
                                positions at larger companies. Eventually, the directors at RevZilla noticed me as a point
                                of consistency and helped me find my next challenge which was to help build a team around
                                our order processing procedures.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                I built a team from scratch using largely unknown talent from within RevZilla’s own fulfillment team. The team was responsible
                                for advocating for customers and their orders. The team interacted with every operations
                                team at RevZilla. I developed procedures and communication structure between my team and
                                customer service, purchasing, fulfillment, and most relevant to my interests, our in house
                                software development team. In addition to the site itself, RevZilla.com also builds almost
                                all admin and SCM software in house. My role was to interpret the needs of our business-unit
                                users and provide relevant feedback to ensure the tools created were up to the task of managing
                                my team’s day-to-day operations and to scale into the future.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                While I recognize now that I’ve skewed away from what should have been an obvious path, I’m ready to correct course. And
                                I’m not even mad; I learned so much in my early career. Many of those experiences further
                                clarified my focus, which is why I’ve decided to enroll in the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.
                                I am ready to make an acute pivot in my career, but take with me the useful skills I’ve already
                                developed. I’ve already been through the start-up ‘bootcamp’, and now I’m poised to add some
                                new tools to my kit and build the next big idea.
